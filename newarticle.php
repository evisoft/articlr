    <h1>Mubarak steps down as President of Egypt</h1>
    <p>Locals with ties to Egypt are joining the hundreds of thousands of 
        people celebrating as President Hosni Mubarak resigns. This comes after
        weeks of protests as demonstrators marched the streets of Cairo demanding
        Mubarak's resignation.</p>

    <p>Egyptian students at the University of Alberta are calling this one of 
        the most important days of their lives.</p>

    <p>"It's the most historic day of my life," said student Mohammed Ahmed.</p>

    <p>The students couldn't hide their happiness and took part in celebrating 
        this milestone for their home country.</p>

    <p>"I work in a lab as a graduate student, and people came and found me crying," said Ahmed.</p>

    <p>On Feb 1st, Mubarak announced he would step down after 30 years in power,
        but added he would stay in power until September. But many continued to
        protest calling on Mubarak to step down immediately.</p>

    <p>An Edmonton woman who lives in Egypt described the celebration in the 
        streets of Cairo early Friday.</p>

    <p>"A lot of laughing and singing and dancing and hugging and kissing and 
        crying, every emotion in the books," said Rena Saad.</p>

    <p>Local political sciences professor says the removal of what he calls a
        dictator through protest and social media could be an inspiration to
        others under oppressive governments.</p>

    <p>"I'm encouraged by this and I think we could see a lot of this
        happening across the Middle East and that would be very good for
        the entire globe," said Andy Knight.</p>

    <p>The military is now in control and pledges to pave the way to 
        democratic elections to form a "legitimate" government chosen by the people.</p>

    <p>The next presidential elections are scheduled for September. Egyptians will be
        watching closely as a number of new candidates and parties are expected
        to be created in the coming months.</p>
